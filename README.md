# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough™ HTML to Be
Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial), possibly the greatest
beginner HTML tutorial in the history of the Universe. You should totally [
check it out](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial), and be sure to [join
the email list](https://www.learnenough.com/#email_list) and

After finishing *Learn Enough™ HTML to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough HTML
to be *dangerous*. 

In the words of the great Michael Hartl, "Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous focuses on core HTML, starting with a “hello, world!” page that we’ll deploy to production (!) in Chapter 1. We’ll then fill in the index page with formatted text, links, and images in Chapter 2, expanding it into a multiple-page site with more advanced features like tables and lists in Chapter 3. Finally, we’ll add some inline styling in Chapter 4, which will allow us to see the effect of simple style rules on plain HTML elements."
